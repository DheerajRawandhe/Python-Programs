# Introduction to Python
Python is a programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is widely used for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, game development, and more.

## Python-Programs
I have learned many concepts in Python, including data types, strings, booleans, loops, and statements. I now understand how to use different data types such as integers and strings etc.

### Key Features of Python:
✔ Easy to Learn – Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it beginner-friendly.
✔ Interpreted Language – Code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.

 I have also learned how to use loops, including for and while loops, to repeat tasks efficiently. Strings and their various methods, such as slicing and concatenation, are now clear to me. Understanding these concepts has helped me write better Python programs.
